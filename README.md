# Expense Tracker

A simple command-line application to track personal expenses, built in Java. This program allows users to add, list, delete, and summarize expenses. The expenses are stored in a file (`expenses.json`) to persist across program runs.

## Features

- **Add Expense**: Add a new expense with a description and amount.
- **List Expenses**: View all expenses with their details (ID, description, amount, and date).
- **Delete Expense**: Delete an expense by its ID.
- **Summary**: View the total amount of all expenses, or filter by a specific month.

## Commands

- `add`: Add a new expense.
    ```bash
    add
    ```
    Prompts you to enter the description and amount of the expense.

- `list`: Lists all expenses.
    ```bash
    list
    ```
    Shows all expenses with ID, date, description, and amount.

- `delete`: Delete an expense by ID.
    ```bash
    delete
    ```
    Prompts you to enter the ID of the expense you wish to delete.

- `summary`: View the total expenses, or filter by month.
    ```bash
    summary
    ```
    Optionally, enter a month (1-12) to filter the summary by month.

- `exit`: Exit the program.
    ```bash
    exit
    ```
    Ends the interactive session.
